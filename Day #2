if statement = code that executes if it's condition is true
age = int(input("How old are you?: ))
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult!")
elif age < 0:
    print("You haven't been born yet!")
   ##Can include as many elif statements as needed, if must be first and else last
else:
    print("You are a child!")

##Logical operators (and,or,not) = used to check if 2 statements meet desired conditions
temp = int(input("What is the temperature outside?")
if temp >= 0 and <= 30:
    print("The temperature is good today")
    print("Go outside!")
    ##If using the and operator, both statements must be true
